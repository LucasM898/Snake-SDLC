# **Snake Game**

## **Project Description**
Snake is a classic arcade game where players control a growing snake that moves across a grid. The objective is to collect food to make the snake longer while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake’s own body. As the snake grows, the game becomes more challenging, testing the player’s reflexes and ability to navigate the grid.
